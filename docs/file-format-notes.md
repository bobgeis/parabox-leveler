### Header

The header is all lines before "#". "version" is the only required item. Here are all available items, and comments in parentheses:
  - version 4 (only required item)
  - attempt_order push,enter,eat,possess (used in Priority area in-game with value "enter,eat,push,possess".)
  - shed (enables Shed area behavior)
  - inner_push (enables Inner Push area behavior)
  - draw_style tui (Text graphics)
  - draw_style grid (Like tui, but with blocks instead of text)
  - draw_style oldstyle (Gallery area development graphics)
  - custom_level_music -1 (-1 means no music)
  - custom_level_palette -1 (-1 means no palette is applied)

### Objects

After the # line, objects are listed. *Tab* indentation indicates block children.

- Block x y id width height hue sat val zoomfactor fillwithwalls player possessable playerorder fliph floatinspace specialeffect
    A block, which has children objects.

    - x - x position
    - y - y position
    - id - block ID number
    - width, height - internal size of block
    - hue, sat, val - color
    - zoomfactor - camera zoom when in this block, 1 is normal
    - fillwithwalls - if 1, this block gets turned into a 1x1 with a wall inside it
    - player - if 1, this block is a player
    - possessable - if 1, this block is possessable
    - playerorder - if player is set, this number is the order in which this player moves, if there are multiple players
    - fliph - if 1, this block is flipped
    - floatinspace - if 1, this block will not actually be at this x,y position. instead, it will have no parent, and will "float in space". this property exists as a hack so that you can make levels with these kinds of blocks, while keeping the level structure in the editor just 1 tree, instead of 2 or more trees.
    - specialeffect - magic number used to flag blocks in various situations.
    eg:
      - root block `Block -1 -1 0 9 9 0.6 0.8 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
      - player block `Block 5 5 2 5 5 0.9 1 0.7 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0`

- Ref x y id exitblock infexit infexitnum infenter infenternum infenterid player posssessable playerorder fliph floatinspace specialeffect
    A reference to a Block that is defined elsewhere in the file.

    - x - x position
    - y - y position
    - id - block this is a reference to
    - exitblock - if 1, this is the exit block for this level (setting this to 0 makes it a "clone" reference, there should be only one exit reference per block)
    - infexit - if 1, this is an infexit block for this level
    - infexitnum - degree of infexit, if that is set
    - infenter - if 1, this is an infenter block for some level
    - infenternum - degree of infenter, if that is set
    - infenterid - which level is infenter, if that is set
    eg `Ref 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0`

- Wall x y player possessable playerorder
    A wall.
    eg: `Wall 3 4 0 0 0`

- Floor x y type
    A floor object. Types are: Button, PlayerButton
    eg: `Floor 1 0 PlayerButton`
